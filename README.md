# yeelight-bulb-control
Simple GUI project for controling yeelight led bulbs

## 1. Configuration
* First you need to enable "Lan Control" for the bulb, so it can be controlled in your local network (use the yeelight phone app).
* You will also need to install yeelight library via `pip install yeelight` or using the requirements.txt file.
* One of the functions uses the match-case syntax so you will need python >= 3.10.
