# yeelight-bulb-control
Simple GUI project for controling yeelight led bulbs

## 1. Configuration
* First you need to enable "Lan Control" for the bulb, so it can be controlled in your local network (use the yeelight phone app).
* If you just want to use the program download the "standalone_app" folder and run "YeelightApp.exe".
* You will also need to install yeelight library via `pip install yeelight` or using the requirements.txt file.
* One of the functions uses the match-case syntax so you will need python >= 3.10.

## 2. Usage
* Enter the bulb's ip address and click connect.
* Use the provided on/off button and brigthness, color temp, saturation and hue sliders to change the bulb state.
* Change the bulb to one of the presets by clicking on the "scenes" buttons.
